# Music-ML-Magic
A music analysis system that classifies music into different genres, making use of the GTZAN dataset.

## 1. Introduction:
The objective of this project is to design and implement a music genre classification system that aids in categorizing music tracks into predefined genres. Music genre classification holds significant importance in various applications, including music recommendation systems and content organization.

## 2. Problem Statement:
The main challenge addressed by this project is to develop an accurate and efficient music genre classification system. The system should be capable of processing audio data and assigning appropriate genre labels using machine learning techniques.

## 3. Project Goals:
The primary goals of this project are as follows:
  1. Develop a music analysis system capable of classifying music tracks into distinct genres.
  2. Provide a beginner-friendly approach by dividing the development process into incremental steps.
  3. Utilize the GTZAN dataset for training and evaluating the classification models.
  4. Implement a range of classification algorithms, from basic to advanced, to achieve optimal accuracy.
  5. Document the development process thoroughly, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.

## 4. Methodology:
The project was executed using the following methodology:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: The GTZAN dataset was chosen for its suitability for music genre classification. However, the dataset presented challenges like corrupted files, which were resolved through data sanitization.

Step-wise Implementation: The project followed a progressive approach:

  1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting the dataset, handling missing values, and extracting relevant features.
  2. Basic Classification: Implementing simple algorithms like Naive Bayes and Decision Trees to establish a baseline.
  3. Intermediate Classification: Employing more advanced techniques such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines.
  4. Advanced Classification: Developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to capture complex audio patterns.

## 5. Technical Stack: 
The project was implemented using the following technical components:
  Environment: Anaconda environment for managing dependencies.
  Development: Jupyter Notebook for coding and step-by-step execution.
  Libraries: Utilized libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for data handling, modeling, and deep learning.

## 6. Documentation: 
Code documentation was maintained and provided in a separate "code_documentation.pdf" file.

## 7. Challenges Encountered:
Several challenges were faced during the development process:

  1. Dataset Selection: Finding an appropriate dataset with a wide range of music genres was a preliminary challenge.
  2. Loading of dataset.
  3. Corrupted Files: The GTZAN dataset contained corrupted audio files, requiring data sanitization and error handling.
  4. Data Preprocessing for CNN: Preparing audio data for the CNN model, including spectrogram generation and normalization, posed a complex challenge.
  5. Deciding the tech-stack.

## 8. Challenges Resolution:
The challenges were addressed through the following strategies:
  1. Dataset: The GTZAN dataset was selected due to its extensive genre diversity.
  2. Corrupted Files: Corrupted files were identified and removed during data preprocessing.
  3. Tech-stack: I tried various libraries and selected the best.

## 9. Limitations and future scope:
  Considering the current limitations of the project(Data Preprocessing for CNN), it is important to acknowledge areas where improvements can be made in the future.
  As a result, a noteworthy future scope for the project would be to focus on enhancing the data preprocessing techniques. This could involve:
  1. Exploring Advanced Feature Extraction Techniques
  2. Experimenting with Different Preprocessing Pipelines
  3. Seeking Expert Guidance

## 10. Conclusion:
The music genre classification system developed in this project showcases the journey from data preprocessing to advanced classification techniques. By adopting a beginner-friendly, step-by-step approach, the system ensures clarity and comprehension. Challenges faced during development though partially resolved, it resulting in a functional classification system with documented code and well-structured methodology.

In conclusion, this project successfully achieves its goals of creating a music analysis system that accurately categorizes music tracks into genres. The process and outcomes are extensively documented to ensure transparency and understanding for future developers and users.
